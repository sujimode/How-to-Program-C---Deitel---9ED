// Distinguish between the terms fatal error and nonfatal error. Why might you
// prefer to experience a fatal error rather than a nonfatal error?


//     A fatal error is a severe error that causes a program or system to terminate immediately and unexpectedly,
// often resulting in data loss if unsaved. The program cannot continue execution after a fatal error.
    
//     A nonfatal error is a less severe error that allows the program or system to continue running, although
// possibly with reduced functionality or performance. Nonfatal errors do not cause immediate termination and may be
// recoverable by the user or the system itself.


//     One might prefer to experience a fatal error rather than a nonfatal error in certain situations for the
// following reasons: 

//     Immediate Identification and Resolution:
//     Fatal errors provide a clear and undeniable indication that a critical problem exists, forcing immediate
// attention and resolution. Nonfatal errors can be subtle, difficult to diagnose, and might go unnoticed for
// extended periods, potentially leading to cumulative issues or incorrect results.

//     Prevention of Further Damage or Corruption:
//     In cases where an error could lead to data corruption or system instability, a fatal error prevents the
// program from continuing to operate in a compromised state, thereby safeguarding data integrity and preventing
// more severe issues.
    
//     Simplified Debugging:
//     The immediate termination caused by a fatal error often provides a more direct path to identifying the root
// cause of the problem, making debugging and troubleshooting more straightforward compared to tracking down elusive
// nonfatal errors that may only manifest in subtle ways.
