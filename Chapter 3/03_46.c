// (World Population Growth) World population has grown considerably over
// the centuries. Continued growth could eventually challenge the limits of breathable
// air, drinkable water, arable land and other limited resources. Thereâ€™s evidence that
// growth has been slowing in recent years, and that world population could peak some
// time this century, then start to decline.
// For this exercise, research world population growth issues. This is a controversial
// topic, so be sure to investigate various viewpoints. Get estimates for the current
// world population and its growth rate. Write a program that calculates world popula-
// tion growth each year for the next 100 years, using the simplifying assumption that the
// current growth rate will stay constant. Print the results in a table. The first column
// should display the year from 1 to 100. The second column should display the antic-
// ipated world population at the end of that year. The third column should display the
// numerical increase in the world population that would occur that year. Using your
// results, determine the years in which the population would become double and
// eventually quadruple what it is today.
